# WeatherApp

This repository contains the source code for the **WeatherApp** project. It provides instructions on how to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Programming language X (e.g., Python 3.7)
- Framework/library Y (e.g., Django 3.2)
- Database Z (e.g., PostgreSQL)

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
   ```

2. Change into the project's directory:

   ```shell
   cd project-name
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using the package manager for your programming language. For example, if you're using Python with pip:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure the project settings. Typically, this involves creating a configuration file (e.g., `config.py`) and updating it with your local settings, such as database credentials, API keys, etc. You may find a template configuration file (e.g., `config_template.py`) that you can rename and customize.

5. Set up the database. If your project requires a database, create a new database instance and apply the necessary migrations or schema setup. You can use the project's migration scripts or database scripts for this purpose.

6. Start the project. Depending on the project, this step may vary. Here are some common examples:

   - For web applications:

     ```shell
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

   - For command-line applications:

     ```shell
     python main.py
     ```

   - For mobile applications:
     Open the project in your preferred IDE or development environment and run it using the built-in tools or emulators.

   Make sure to consult the project's documentation or README file for specific instructions.

7. Access the project. Once the project is running, you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:port` (replace `port` with the appropriate port number if provided).

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the project, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.

2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
   ```

3. Create a new branch for your changes:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

4. Make your desired changes to the codebase.

5. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages:

   ```shell
   git commit -m "Add feature XYZ"
   ```

6. Push your changes to your forked repository:

   ```shell
   git push origin my-feature
   ```

7. Open a pull request on the original repository and provide a detailed description of your changes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
